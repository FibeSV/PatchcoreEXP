# PatchcoreEXP

## Introduction

Welcome to PatchcoreEXP, a project dedicated to exploring the capabilities and applications of the Patchcore algorithm in anomaly detection within images. This repository contains a series of experiments and implementations aimed at pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Patchcore, providing insights and utilities for data processing, algorithm implementation, and experimental analysis.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following key components:

- `data.py`: This module is responsible for all data processing tasks. It includes functions for loading datasets, preprocessing images, and preparing data for use in the Patchcore experiments.

- `patch_core.py`: The core of the project, this file contains the implementation of the Patchcore algorithm. It outlines the method's architecture, anomaly detection process, and the specifics of how patches are utilized for identifying anomalies in images.

- `report.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook that documents the experiments conducted with the Patchcore algorithm. It includes a detailed analysis of the results, visualizations, and interpretations of the findings to provide a comprehensive view of the algorithm's performance and potential applications.

- `utils.py`: A collection of utility functions that support the project's operations. This includes helper functions for image manipulation, metrics calculation, and any other auxiliary tasks that facilitate the main experiments.
